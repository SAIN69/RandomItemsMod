Greetings o/

This is my time releasing a Minecraft mod via GitHub.
Feel free to leave suggestions as to what I should add - That ranges from items all the way to commands/Guis etc.

A quick description of the RandomItemsMod itself:
-Most of the items are insired by the most popular game on Hypixel "Hypixel SKyblock".
That includes: Custom Unstable Dragon Armor texture, Custom model of the Hyperion (most expensive weapon in the game).

-Wither Shield and Implosion representing the scrolls that you can combine with the Hyperion and give the item abilities.

-Unstable Dragon Fragments with a very cursed texture (They are a bit chunky).

-A Necron's handle and enchanted eye's of ender used to craft the Hyperion (Will try to add wither caralysts as it is one of the original ingridients).



-Some other items that I made myself:
-10 music discs, each one with a simple texture holding nice different songs that were recommended to me.
The songs: Zeus x Crona - Pill, Legends Never Die, Stay With Me, We Will Meet Again, FKJ - Ylang Ylang, Die First, Locked Out Of Heaven.
Each disc with a custom recipe.

-Leaf armor and a Leaf Sword crafted with just Oak leaves.

-A spruce chair with his own crafting recipe, which you can also sit on. (It's rotation sadly has to be indicated by the /summon command).

-A Harry Potter's wand (you can only get it in creative) but if you do get it and hit ANY entity it will grant it Levitation for a few seconds.
-It will also grant you a custom achievement "When Pigs Fly" when hitting an entity.
-You can also summon fireballs by right clicking.
-It can also summon lightning again by right clicking on the ground.
